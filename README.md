**Description:** Investigation into colexification of concepts within language families or geographical areas based on semantic field and ontological catgory using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest classification, SVC and K-means clustering.

**Data:** Data was sourced from the SQL database underlying the [Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications](https://clics.clld.org/).
